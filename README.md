### performance stuff

- investigate performance - offset calcs are most costly?
- avoid unneccessary strand-recalculations
- strand calculations are relatively fast - could start doing them before mouseup
- fuzzy memoization of offset calculations?
- web workers?

### extra features

- triangular and circular grids, and freeform (including real-time dragging)
