## Strand Construction Demo:

For the purposes of this demonstration, we will focus on this knot:

This is a simple example where the knot consists of one strand only.

The demonstration in this repository limits itself to one section of the knot-drawing algorithm, namely the part that produces an array of points through which this strand should pass, based on the frame/graph that is automatically drawn on the screen.

**Not** covered in this repo:

- user interaction
- smoothing of curves between the strand points
- construction of "pointed returns" - i.e. the fancy pointy corners
